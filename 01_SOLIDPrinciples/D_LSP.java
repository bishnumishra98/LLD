// 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types
//                                         without altering the correctness of the program.

// Violation of LSP
class Bird_ {

class Ostrich_ extends Bird_ {

    public void fly() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Ostrich_ can't fly");

}

// Problem: The base class Bird_ has a method 'fly', which assumes that all birds can fly. Ostrich_, being a non-flying bird,
//          violates this assumption by throwing an exception, breaking the substitutability principle. Thus, the Ostrich_ class
//          cannot fully substitute Bird_, as it can't fulfill the behavior of flying. This leads to unexpected behavior in
//          client code when Ostrich_ is treated as a Bird_.
// Solution: Refactor the code by separating birds that can fly from those that can't. This avoids assigning unsupported
//           behaviors to subclasses, ensuring LSP compliance.
