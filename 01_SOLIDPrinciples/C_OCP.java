// 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be

// Problem: The calculate() method is tightly coupled with discount types (CHRISTMAS, NEWYEAR), and every time a new
//          discount type is introduced (e.g., "EASTER", "BLACKFRIDAY"), you'd have to edit the calculate() method,
//          increasing the chances of breaking existing functionality or introducing bugs.
// Solution: Use inheritance (OR) interface to extend without modifying existing code. Below is illustration using inheritance:

abstract class Discount {   // An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly.
    public abstract double calculate(double amount);   // abstract methods must be implemented by any non-abstract subclass.
}

class ChristmasDiscount extends Discount {
    @Override
    public double calculate(double amount) {
        return amount * 0.1;
    }
}

class NewYearDiscount extends Discount {
    @Override
    public double calculate(double amount) {
        return amount * 0.15;
    }
}

// You can add more discounts without modifying existing code.
class EasterDiscount extends Discount {
    @Override
    public double calculate(double amount) {
        return amount * 0.2;
    }
}

// This class is designed to apply different types of discounts in a flexible
// and extensible way, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle (OCP).
class DiscountService {
    public double applyDiscount(Discount discount, double amount) {
        return discount.calculate(amount);
    }
}

        System.out.println("Christmas Discounted Amount: " + christmasDiscountedAmount);  // o/p: Christmas Discounted Amount: 10.0
