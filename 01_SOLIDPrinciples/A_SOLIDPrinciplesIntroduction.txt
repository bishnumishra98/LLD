The SOLID principles are a set of design principles in object-oriented programming that help in writing clean,
maintainable, and scalable code, especially in Low-Level Design (LLD). These principles are important for designing
robust systems and are widely used in software development to improve code quality and flexibility. These principles
were introduced by Robert C. Martin, often known as "Uncle Bob." SOLID stands for:

S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
O: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
L: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

The SOLID principles help improve the design of software systems by making them more modular, flexible, and maintainable.
Applying these principles results in cleaner code that is easier to extend, test, and debug, ultimately leading to more
robust and scalable software designs.
